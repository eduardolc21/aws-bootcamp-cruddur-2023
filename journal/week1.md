This week I completed the following:

Create a new GitHub repo and launch de repo within Gitpod workspace for the 1st week
I also Clone the frontend and backend repo, even though I had some problems with frontend, because my dockercompose file did not work at first but later I realized that dickercomposefile was inside of front-end folder. I already corrected the mistake
Write a Dockerfile for each app and made sure they were up and running along with open ports
Ensure we can orchestrate multiple containers to run side by side
Mount directories so we can make changes while we code
