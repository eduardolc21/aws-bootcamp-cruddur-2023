This week I completed the following:


1) Create a new GitHub repo and launch de repo within Gitpod workspace for the 1st week

2) I also Clone the frontend and backend repo, even though I had some problems with frontend, because my dockercompose file did not work at first but later I realized that dickercomposefile was inside of front-end folder. I already corrected the mistake

3) Write a Dockerfile for each app and made sure they were up and running along with open ports

4) I Learned about security best practices

5) I also learned about: https://snyk.io/product/open-source-security-management/ and https://github.com/quay/clair, where I can scan vulnerabilities in my docker files.
